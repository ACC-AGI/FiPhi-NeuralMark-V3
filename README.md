## 🧠 How It Works

FiPhi-NeuralMark uses multiple neural network models, each designed to perform specific tasks like text generation, learning patterns, and providing meaningful responses.

1. **Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)**: Helps generate a base-level response by learning from previous word sequences. ⚡
2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: Provides sequential prediction by understanding word dependencies in text. 🔄
3. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Detects patterns and processes input data efficiently, useful in word feature extraction. 🖼️
4. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Handles long-term dependencies and understands complex sequences for generating detailed responses. 🔄💡
5. **Transformer**: Focuses on attention mechanisms and improves contextual understanding to generate high-quality text. 💥
6. **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: Optimizes the parameters for model training, ensuring continuous improvement of text generation. 🧬

These models work together to provide accurate and creative text generation.
